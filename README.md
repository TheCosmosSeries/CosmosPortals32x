# Cosmos Portals 32x Resource Pack

### Introduction
Original 32x textures for the [Cosmos Portals](https://github.com/TheCosmosSeries/CosmosPortals) mod.

The Cosmos Portals mod transitioned away from 32x native textures in favor of 16x textures to better match the look and feel of Minecraft. This pack is for those people who are playing with 32x Resource Packs or prefer the 32x textures.

### Dependencies
This pack requires **Cosmos Portals**. Without which this pack will do _nothing_.

### Mod Pages
- Cosmos Portals 32x on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cosmos-portals-32x)
- Cosmos Portals 32x on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosmos-portals-32x)

## The Cosmos Series
